/**
 * Helper class to allow placing placing an interstitial ad in an XML layout.  As such this class
 * is only intended to be used in XML layouts and the resulting instance should just be casted
 * to the base MASTAdView class.
 * <p>
 * Note this must be added with a width/height of 0 and a visibility state of INVISIBLE.  Do not
 * attempt to present this view directly as a normal view.
 * <p>
 * When the ad is loaded with a set zone the ad will request an update and display the interstitial
 * after it has been downloaded and rendered.
